// Need to pair drug and patient, basically like giving the patient a dosage of the drug
// Update currentTotalDoses and currentDoseFid of the patient by searching Drugs for one assigned
// to the patient (patientUuid === patient.uuid) and used is null (doesnt exist) then add with value if true

// Need to add a patient visit/appointment to a patient


// Admin
// Need to be able to update all ELIGIBLE patients (ACLs) so FDA and Bavaria at end of trial can get (READ) extra patient info
// Notify FDA and Bavaria when study is over?


// Get all patients
// Admin should be able to also see eligiblity, but not the doctor (we will soft block this?)
